## Challenge

Design and implement an algorithm to determine whether
one string is a rotation of another.

## Levels

* Beginner: Implement an algorithm to solve the problem
* Intermediate: Implement an algorithm in a single line of code

## Examples

* `apple` is a rotation of `apple`
* `pplea` is a rotation of `apple`
* `pleap` is a rotation of `apple`
* `paple` is *not* a rotation of `apple`
* `elppa` is *not* a rotation of `apple`

## Limitations

None within reason. You shouldn't need any external
libraries beyond the basic functionality provided by
your programming language.
