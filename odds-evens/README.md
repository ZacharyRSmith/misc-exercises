This is an exercise from [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/problems_solutions_algorithms.markdown#odds--evens).

The instructions are:

"I have a file with 100 numbers. I want to create two new files: one with all the odds and one with all the evens.

Extension: Don't allow duplicates in the output"
